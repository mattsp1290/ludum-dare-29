This is my entry for Ludum Dare 29.

I will be making and keeping random notes here as well as useful information.

The game is going to be based on the SNES resolution of 256 x 224 scaled up to 1024 x 896. Why? Because why not.

The game can be tested at http://ludum-dar-107708.use1-2.nitrousbox.com/ludum-dare-29/
